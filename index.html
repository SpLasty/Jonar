          <h1>Welcome To My Cover Letter</h1>
          <p class="lead">This is my cover letter application for Junior software developer intern. Without any further Ado, Let's get on with it !</p>

        <section id="about">
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="lead">I am Faiz (Pronounced as Faze). I am a third year international student at University of Calgary, majoring in Computer Science.
                My areas of interest include games, true crimes and technology. I have a keen interest on cinema and my favorite movie is Inception, which I have watched more than 50 times since last year.
                When I am not watching movies or playing games, I like to keep myself busy by reading tech blogs, attending tech and cs related workshops and doing web development projects.

            <h1>Why Am I a fit for this job </h1>
            <h2>Cultural Fit</h2>
            <p>I resonate a lot with the article, posted on Jonar's blog, titled "Leading with Imposter Syndrome".
                I have struggled with imposter syndrome, being fearful of the unknown future. I was afraid to step out of comfort zone.
                But there was a quote from the movie Inception which stuck with me and was an eye opener. "Would you like to take a leap of faith or become an old man filled with regret, waiting to die alone".
                I wouldn't say there was an instant effect, but it hit me and I knew I had to take risks in order to succeed. Since, then I have boarded the plane and flew all the way from Bangladesh to Canada(which was essentially my first flight ever) and I have learned to adjust here in a completely new environment.
                In terms of cultural fit, I am adaptable to new settings which help me fit easily into a new ecosystem without disrupting it. I am no longer afraid to ask the questions and make mistakes in order to learn more and succeed eventually.
            </p>
            <h2>Job Fit</h2>
            <p class="lead"> I am very passionte when it comes to software and web development. I like to build projects on my own during my free time to facilitate my learning.
                I am still on the learning process and I am actively learning new technology stacks and improving on my skills. While I lack experience, I have the desire and hunger to learn and I think that sets me up as a right candidate.
                I am also willing to relocate if required for the job.
